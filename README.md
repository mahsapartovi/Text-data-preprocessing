# Text-data-preprocessing

Data minning project

In this project, I wrote a program in which it takes 3 books as input, 
1. tokenizing the texts
2.specifies the negative and positive sentences separately (Lines marked with zero are positive sentences and lines with a number one at the end are negative sentences.)
3.and the number of repetitions of each word and its location in the text.

good luck :)
