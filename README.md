# Text-data-preprocessing

Data mining project

In this project, I wrote a program that takes 3 books as input, 
1. Tokenizing the texts
2. specifies the negative and positive sentences separately (Lines marked with zero are positive sentence,s and lines with a number one at the end are negative sentences.)
3. and the number of repetitions of each word and its location in the text.

Good luck :)
